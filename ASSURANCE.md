# Assurance ladder

Six rungs. Each licenses a strictly stronger claim and costs more. A port's
claim is capped by the **weaker** of its two ends.

| Rung | Method | Base-app changes | Licenses |
|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Generated conformance replay | none | Agreement on the generated corpus |
| R1 | Differential trace agreement against a live base process | none (JSONL adapter only) | Agreement on N sampled traces, within the generator's distribution |
| R2 | Shared property + metamorphic suite | none | Named relations hold in both |
| R3 | TLC on `twitter.tla`, plus the `S_obs` link check | n/a | The model satisfies F1-F9 at bound; `S_obs` refines it. Says nothing about code |
| R4 | Per-language deductive proof of F1-F9 | none | Each implementation satisfies the same property *numbers*. **Not equivalence** |
| R5 | Per-language refinement to `S_obs` | none | **A and B are observationally equivalent, on every request sequence** |
| R6 | Machine-checked agreement across the four `S_obs` renderings | — | Not reachable. See below |

## R5's obligation

For each implementation L, an abstraction function `abs_L : State_L -> State_S`
with

```
abs_L(init_L)       = init_S
resp_L(s, r)        = resp_S(abs_L(s), r)          for all s, r
abs_L(step_L(s, r)) = step_S(abs_L(s), r)          for all s, r
```

Determinism and totality of `S_obs` make these compose by induction on trace
length, which is what yields equivalence by transitivity through the spec.

## Why R6 is not reachable, and what is done instead

No tool checks that a Verus `spec fn`, a Gobra ghost predicate, and a JML model
field denote the same machine. Four hand-written renderings of `S_obs` would be
four independent chances to say something subtly different, with nothing
comparing them.

Mitigation: **generate** all four renderings from one source. That collapses
the obligation from "four specs agree" to "`specgen` is correct" -- which is
reviewable, and which can be mutation-tested by injecting `specgen` mutants
that must break at least one implementation's proof.

The residual gap is real and is recorded in [TCB.md](TCB.md) rather than
argued away.

## Ceiling per corner

| Corner | R0-R3 | R4 | R5 | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rust | yes | Verus | Verus | **R5** |
| Go | yes | Gobra | Gobra | **R5** |
| Java | yes | OpenJML / KeY | JML refinement | **R5** |
| Kotlin | yes | none | none | **R3 + bounded** |

**Kotlin has no mature deductive verifier.** The best available is compiling to
JVM bytecode and running JBMC for bounded model checking, plus kotest property
tests. So any port with Kotlin at either end cannot exceed bounded and
differential evidence, however strong the other end is.

That asymmetry is a result the matrix is designed to surface, not a defect to
engineer around.

## Port-claim table

For a port B <- A with no changes to A:

| Evidence | Strongest honest claim |
|---|---|
| R0-R2 | "B agrees with A on every trace sampled." Statistical; the kill rate is the number |
| + R3 | "...and the model both target satisfies F1-F9 at bound k" |
| + R4 both ends | "...and both independently satisfy F1-F9." Still not equivalence |
| + R5 both ends | "**B and A are observationally equivalent**", modulo the TCB |
| R5 on A only | "A is correct; B is only as good as R0-R2." The port itself is unproven |

## Current status

| Rung | State |
|---|---|
| R0 | Corpus **generated** from `S_obs`, 54 steps, regeneration byte-stable. No implementation replays it yet |
| R1 | Not built. Phase 1 |
| R2 | Not built. Phase 1 |
| R3 | **PASSING.** TLC green on `twitter.tla` (8,989,719 distinct states, depth 20). `S_obs` link check green over 16 state-changing steps, and the known-bad canary is correctly rejected |
| R4 | Not started. Phase 1 |
| R5 | Not started. Phase 1 |
| R6 | Not reachable by design |

No claim above R3 is currently supported by anything in this repository, and
none should be made.
